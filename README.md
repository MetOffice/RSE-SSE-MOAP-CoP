# RSE-SSE MOAP CoP

The Met Office Academic Partnership (MOAP) is a formal collaboration between the
Met Office (MO) and leading UK universities to advance weather and climate
science. Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and Scientific Software Engineers
(SSEs) develop software that enable this science. A Community of Practice (CoP)
is a group of people who share a common interest and interact regularly to
improve their understanding and skills related to that interest.
